Just a lightweight launcher for Bloodborne on shadPS4

**Installation:**

  Windows: Just place the exe next the shadPS4 exe. If you are using an SDL (no GUI) build for shadPS4, the other files in the BB Launcher folder have to be also transferred to the shadPS4 folder.
  
  Linux/Mac: The Launcher will ask for the shadPS4 binary/AppImage on startup. BBLauncher would need executable permission to run (chmod +x)

  GUI can be skipped with command line argument -n (--args -n on Mac), only once the install folder has been set-up in the GUI.

**Mod Installation:**

  Click the mods folder and place the mods in the opened location. The mod folder should be the name of the mod, and inside that folder should be a Bloodborne game folder (dvdroot_ps4 or one of its subfolders).
  
  Example:  Mods/Vertex Explosion fix/parts

**Current features:**
  - Fixes the sound glitch when you crash at 60 fps
  - Creates backup saves after a configurable interval
  - Mod manager (similar to the Generic Mod Manager on nexus, but automatically structures folders)
  - Change shadPS4 settings from the launcher
  - Enable Bloodborne patches from the launcher
  - View save info and restore backup saves with the GUI
  - Trophy locking/unlocking

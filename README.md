Just a lightweight launcher for Bloodborne on shadPS4 (if I can get around to working on it)

Installation:
  Just place the exe next the shadPS4 exe. If you are using an SDL (no GUI) build for shadPS4, the other files in the BB Launcher folder have to be also transferred to the shadPS4 folder.

  GUI can be skipped with command line argument -n, only once the install folder has been set-up in the GUI.

Current features:
  - Fixes the sound glitch when you crash at 60 fps
  - Creates backup saves after a configurable interval
  - Mod manager (similar to the Generic Mod Manager on nexus, but automatically structures folders)
  - Change shadPS4 settings from the launcher
  - Enable Bloodborne patches from the launcher
  - View save info and restore backup saves with the GUI

Planned features:  
  - Trophy locking/unlocking (on hold while waiting for an easier way to dump trophy keys)
